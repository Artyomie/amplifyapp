                                <p> My name is Artem Latypov, I am majoring in Computer Science at Middlesex County College. 
                                    I am studying in the pursuit of becoming a software developer and moving to Europe with my wife one day to start a career and family.
                                    I was born in Russia, in the Siberian city of Omsk. My parents were programmers themselves and moved to Los Angeles, California when I was young.
                                    We then later moved to New Jersey when my parent's job moved to New York and I attended East Brunswick High School. I originally came to MCC to major in
                                    Chemistry, intending to study pharmacology - however I decided to study Computer Science instead since it had been my interest since I've been young. 
                                    Some of my other interest are cooking with my wife, reading, playing instruments, and working on programming projects.
                                    
                                </p>
